# Zeplane Hubot Script

This is a simple hubot script to pull the list of plane data from adsbexchange.com, and search the data for Ohio HWP and Columbus City Police planes/copters.  It will return the position and plane information for any that are in the air, along with a link for that plane in flightaware.com

TODO:  Will need to add surrounding code to make sulf sustaining bot, as this was pulled out from a larger bot with more commands
